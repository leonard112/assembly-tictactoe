# Assembly Language Tic Tac Toe

> :warning: ___Disclaimer:__ These code examples don't always adhere to proper calling conventions that would be used in production level code. These samples are very pragmatic in general purpose register usage and in how function prologues and epilogues are constructed and used. When writing production level code, the recommended calling conventions for each instruction set should be used._

This repository contains an implementation of a simple Tic Tac Toe game in low level assembly code for the following CPU architectures:
* `i386`
* `amd64`
* `armhf`
* `aarch64`
* `ppc64`
* `s390x`
