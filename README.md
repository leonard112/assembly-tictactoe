# Assembly Language Tic Tac Toe

> :warning: ___Disclaimer:__ These code examples should not be looked at as a guide for best practices in writing low level assembly code, but instead they should be looked at as an example of what the mnemonics are in each instruction set, and how common operations are performed in each instruction set._

This repository contains an implementation of a simple Tic Tac Toe game in low level assembly code for the following CPU architectures:
* `i386`
* `amd64`
* `armhf`
* `arm64`
* `s390x`
