# Assembly Language Tic Tac Toe

> :warning: ___Disclaimer:__ These code examples should not be looked at as a guide for best practices in writing low level assembly code. Production level code for firmware, operating systems, and other production uses for assembly code would likely use different calling conventions and register usage for better modularity in large and complex systems. These examples should be looked at as examples of what the mnemonics are in each instruction set and how common operations are performed in each instruction set._

This repository contains an implementation of a simple Tic Tac Toe game in low level assembly code for the following CPU architectures:
* `i386`
* `amd64`
* `armhf`
* `aarch64`
* `s390x`
